## Instructions

Memory Game is a memory game where you need to match pairs of cards. Playing is very simple - you turn over one card and then try to find a matching card.

If you find all matching pairs in less than 15 moves, you get 3 stars. If you find all matching pairs in 15 moves or more but less than 25 moves, you get 2 stars. Else you get 1 star.

Try to find in the fastest time and less moves that you can !
